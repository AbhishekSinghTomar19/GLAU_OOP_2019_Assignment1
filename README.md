#### Problem Statement

Recall, that if an object is released so that it falls,
the speed of the object at time `t` seconds after its release
is calculated to be `gt` and the distance the object has travelled
in those `t` seconds after its release is 
![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$\frac{1}{2}g{t^2}$$).
Here, `g` is the gravity constant. Its value is approximately `9.8`.  

Write a program in which, the method main performs the following actions:  
1. The program declares the variables `time` for time, `speed` for the speed, and `distance` for the distance travelled.
2. The program assigns value to `time`.
3. The program calculates the speed and the distance.
4. The program prints the calculated values.
